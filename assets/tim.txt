Tim: Azriel! How good to see you today.
Azriel: Tim! Mallory's gone missing! I need your help to find her!
Tim: Oh no! Let's leave right away and start looking!
 :Tim runs to the door as you notice a giant pile of homework.
Azriel: Tim...do you have time to help me look for Mallory?
Tim: Sure I do. I just have 7 group projects, a few final exams and...
Tim: ...a group project where we have to make a covid vaccine.
Tim: So it's par for the course, I'll be fine!
Azriel: Tim! You need to prioritize. You don't have time to spare!
Tim: Maybe you're right, let me check my calendar.
 :Do you want to help Tim find time to spare on his calendar?
